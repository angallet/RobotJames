          <p class="lead">We used the following devices and sensors:
            <div>
<center>
    4 motors<br />   
    Gyroscope<br />   
    Ultrasonic sensor<br />   
    Color and light sensor<br />   
              </center></p>
            
<br />
            <p>
The number of motors and sensors available was limited by the number of ports and
by the architecture itself, as adding too many components would yield serious
              issues in terms of mobility, speed and precision. </p>
           <br />
          <p>
            For instance, we noticed that
if the robot was particularly heavy the wheel’s axel would be deformed as a
consequence, yielding problems such as impossibility to maintain a certain
direction precisely or causing the robot to turn slightly left or right when the
            motors were started. </p><br />
          <p>
            Moreover, we rapidly went to a simple and efficient solution : using a catapult to throw the balls.
            Moreover, we noticed that the motors would be more
imprecise when it came to turn left or right if the weight over the wheels
wouldn’t be evenly distributed. In order to solve these problem we tried 
            several architectures until we achieved a satisfying one.
          </p> <br />
          <p><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="2.jpg" class="rotation180"><br />
The adopted architecture allows to distribute the weight in a more even way
between the two wheels and the metal ball,  with respect to the center of mass of
          the ev3dev block and as the distance between them is approximately the same. 
          Also, stability is greatly improved by placing the ev3dev board in the centerd 
          line at the front of the robot, with respect to the axel.
          This choice also allowed us to use all the available ports and to connect the color sensor 
          and the motor placed in the front for the catapult. Lastly, the ultrasonic sensor was mounted
          in the front just under the ev3c block in order to have a clear area in front of it. 
          Thus we could detect with a better precision the objects arount the robot. 
            img class="img-fluid rounded" src="3.jpg" class="rotation90"><br />
          In order to grab a ball, the robot just have to make a 180° round. The gyroscope was placed 
          on top of the main structure where it is the most stable and rigid structure in order to avoid improper movements
          of the gyrospcope, close to the brick itself since we noticed that this reduced vibrations and increased precision.
          </p><br />
          <p><h1><center>
          Motors</center></h1>
<br /><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="motorside.jpg" ><br />
          
Two big motors where used to turn the wheels, which are placed in the front of the robot. They also ensure stability.<br />
          <p>
 Placing the wheels in the front and the metal ball in the back
allowed us to greatly mitigate the problem of imprecision of turning, as they now occupy a central
position . Hence unwanted torques are minimized when turning,
            resulting in a higher precision.</p>
<br /><p>
          <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="motorfront.jpg" ><br />
The third big motor was used to turn the axle connected to two LEGO
mechanical arms mounted in the back. Turning the axle could allow us to pick up the ball placed in front of the robot.
          This mechanism was exploited in order to hold and release the non movable object within the arena. This motor is used synchronously with the fourth motor in order to complete the picking up and throwing ball part.
          <br /></p>
          <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="motortop.jpg" ><br />
          <p>
The fourth motor was placed at the top,  in
order to allow the rotation of the catapult. This motor is essential. It turns rapidly and permit the robot to throw the ball 30-40 cm away from the robot .
          This motor opens the catapult'arm before picking up ball. Then it turns in reverse sense in order to get back at the starting position.
          Finally the third motor turns once again so that the ball falls in the catapult'arm. The catapult's motor turns again in order to throw the ball.</p>
        <br />    
          <center><h1>
            Gyroscope</h1></center>
            <br />
<p>
The gyroscope was mounted on top of the robot, on a stable place. We used it for
recalibration purposes and in order to make the robot turn to a certain angle with a good precision
For instance, we used the gyroscope to associate a certain angle to each
  ultrasonic sensor reading.</p>
           <br />
            <center><h1>
              Ultrasonic sensor</h1></center>
<br /><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="sensorultra.jpg" ><br />
          <p>
The ultrasonic sensor was used to scan the area from one side to another in order to detect the ball and the walls, borders and in order to locate the ball to get. Although the sensor is in principle capable of measuring distances up to 250 cm, after careful testing we realized that, past 20 cm, the sensor is not reliable any longer. This issue was most likely due to echoes from corner which would confound the sensor at distances larger than 20 cm.
<br />
We decided to make the robot stop when the distance was reached and the ball was detected by the color sensor.
After this, the robot moves backward in order to make sure that it won’t bump into additional walls or obstacles which may be around.
            <br />    </p>  
         <center><h1>   
Color  sensor</h1></center>
<br /><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="sensorcoloc.jpg" ><br />p>
This sensor, placed in the back of the robot just in front of the catapult, was used to detect the the balls 
          and acknowledge their presence, since the project assignment specified that moveable objects 
          are always colored balls. The output of this sensor is read every time the ultrasonic sensor detects 
          an obstacle in front of the robot which is a ball, and after the use of the front motor to grab the detected ball to ensure that the robot got it.</p>

            Lego EV3

This project is running on a Lego EV3.

It has been conceived during the Operating Systems course at EURECOM, proposed by Prof. Ludovic Apvrille.

Thanks to PhD student Matteo Bertolino for his help.
